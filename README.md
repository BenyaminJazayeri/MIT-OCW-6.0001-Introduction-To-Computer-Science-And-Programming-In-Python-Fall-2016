My coursework for MIT OCW 6.0001 Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python Fall 2016 class.

All solutions are my own.

The In-Class Questions were completed directly on the OCW website and are not included here.

Taught by [Dr. Ana Bell](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Dr.+Ana+Bell), [Prof. Eric Grimson](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+Eric+Grimson) and [Prof. John Guttag](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=Prof.+John+Guttag).

## Projects

### [RSS Feed Filter with Trigger System](./Problem%20Set%205)
A news feed filtering application with a deep OOP inheritance hierarchy implementing strategy and composite design patterns. Includes phrase, time, and logical (And/Or/Not) triggers that compose into complex filter rules, a configuration file parser for defining triggers declaratively, and a Tkinter GUI that polls RSS feeds on a background thread.

### [Caesar Cipher and Substitution Cipher with OOP](./Problem%20Set%204)
A recursive permutation generator connected to two encryption systems. A Caesar cipher with brute-force decryption (trying all 26 shifts, scoring by valid English words), and a substitution cipher that tries all 120 vowel permutations. Demonstrates class inheritance (Message -> PlaintextMessage/CiphertextMessage) and composing components across files.

### [Scrabble-like Word Game with Wildcards](./Problem%20Set%203)
A word game where players form words from dealt letter hands for points. Features wildcard support (the `*` character can substitute for any vowel during validation), hand substitution, and multi-hand game orchestration using dictionary-based hand management.
